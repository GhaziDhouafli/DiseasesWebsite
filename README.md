# Parkinsons_Disease_Prediction_Website
In this project, I was able to put my skills in both ML and Streamlit to create a website that can tell you wether or not the person has the parkinsons disease.First of all i begin by getting the data from kaggle (It's uploaded in the repository) and trying to make a model based on it that can predict the disease.

## **1- Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.
